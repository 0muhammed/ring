Hello Every body
Now we will write hello world program
just one line of code
Yes you are right
Comments are written directly
 
See "Hello World" + nl

now we will learn about control structures

let us start 

for x = 1 to 5

	see x + nl

	if x = 3 see "this is number three" + nl ok
	
	i will avoid one case 

	if x = 4 loop ok

next

we will create a function called test
we can call the function before the definition

test()

func test
	see "This is a test " + nl
